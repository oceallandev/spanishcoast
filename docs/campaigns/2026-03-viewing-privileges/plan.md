# Strategic Plan: Signature Viewing Privileges (Mar 1 – Apr 30, 2026)

## 1) Objective (What Success Looks Like)

- Increase qualified viewing trips booked and attended in March–April.
- Convert more viewings to binding reservations/contracts inside the window.
- Maintain premium brand positioning (no discount-led messaging).
- Drive partner contribution (affiliates/collaborators) as a measurable pipeline source.

Primary KPI targets (set internally):
- Viewings booked (weekly)
- Viewings attended (weekly)
- Binding contracts signed (weekly)
- Completion pipeline value (rolling)
- Partner contribution % (weekly)
- No-show rate, time-to-first-contact, and cost/liability of credits committed

## 2) Positioning (Luxury, Not “Cheap”)

Position as “Private Client privileges” that underwrite serious due diligence:
- “We structure the trip so it’s decisive.”
- “If you complete, we credit back your viewing trip costs (within caps).”
- “New builds: return stay credit to finish the job (choices, snagging, handover).”

Avoid:
- “Free vacation”, “discount”, “cashback” language

Preferred language:
- “Completion credits”
- “Receipt-based caps”
- “Private Client”
- “Structured itinerary”

## 3) Offer Mechanics (Locked)

Eligibility trigger:
- Binding reservation/private purchase contract signed between Mar 1 and Apr 30, 2026 (CET/CEST).

Payment:
- Credits paid at completion only (not at reservation).
- Receipt-based; capped.

New builds:
- Viewing Trip Credit (receipt-based reimbursement at completion) + Return Stay Credit (travel credit/voucher issued at completion; no cash alternative; valid 12 months), caps tiered by purchase price:
  - €250k–€399k: €1,500 + €750
  - €400k–€699k: €2,500 + €1,000
  - €700k–€999k: €3,500 + €1,250
  - €1,000,000+: €5,000 + €1,500

Resales:
- Monthly VIP credit (March + April): first binding resale private contract each month gets Viewing Trip Credit up to €1,500, paid at completion.
- All resale signers in the window get Completion Concierge Pack (non-monetary).

## 4) Funnel & Operations (Make It Convert)

Pre-trip (48 hours):
- 15 min Buyer Blueprint call
- Curated shortlist (8–12) with 3 must-see picks + backups
- Itinerary locked with time blocks and “decision checkpoints”

On-trip:
- Tight schedule (reduce drive waste)
- Midday re-prioritisation
- End-of-day decision call: reserve / second view / next shortlist

Post-trip (24 hours):
- Buyer dossier: top 3, risks, next steps, and contract timeline
- Clear reserve-by deadlines

## 5) Partner Engine (Aggressive Distribution, Premium Wrapper)

Partner segmentation:
- Core 10–20 “power partners”: relocation consultants, mortgage brokers, expat community leaders, buyer agents, developers’ sales teams

Partner enablement:
- Partner kit (EN/DE/NL/FR)
- Unique tracking links (`?aff=CODE`) + suggested `?lang=de|nl|fr`
- Weekly hot shortlist drops (twice/week)

Cadence:
- Weekly 15-minute partner call (pipeline + objections)
- Weekly leaderboard and wins (who booked viewings; who converted)
- Launch burst (Mar 1–3) + final burst (Apr 21–30)

Incentives (optional, internal):
- Speed bonus per qualified viewing attended
- Conversion bonus per contract signed inside the window

## 6) Content Calendar (Minimum Effective Set)

Launch week:
- 1 announcement post + 1 “new builds” post + 1 “resale VIP” post
- 1 live Q&A/webinar slot or virtual tour within 72 hours

Weekly:
- 2 posts (new build angle + resale angle)
- 1 partner drop: new inventory + best value picks by budget band

Final 10 days:
- Scarcity language: “limited availability” + “window closes Apr 30”
- Extra call slots + viewing calendar availability push

## 7) Risk Controls (Margin + Abuse Protection)

Non-negotiables:
- Completion-only payment
- Receipt-based caps
- One buying party per purchase; non-transferable
- VIP selection by recorded signature timestamp; fallback if cancelled/ineligible
- Offer may end early if capacity is reached

Internal control:
- Maintain a running “credit liability” number (committed caps) vs campaign budget
- Do not approve exceptions ad-hoc without owner sign-off
