    "description": "A Mediterranean soul, reborn.&#13;&#13;This is a story of transformation - an architectural rebirth that pays tribute to the past while embracing a serene, contemporary lifestyle. Nestled in La Fustera, in a consolidated neighborhood just 1200 m from the beach, and steps from restaurants and the rhythm of everyday life, this home stands quietly behind a wall of greenery, where the forest once stretched uninterrupted.&#13;&#13;A Home Reborn from the Past&#13;The original house, with its whitewashed walls and traditional rooflines, offered the bones of a classic Mediterranean dwelling. Today, it has been fully reimagined: a sculptural reinterpretation where light, space, and nature converge. The renovation opened generous windows, redefined spaces, and introduced noble, tactile materials that speak to both comfort and authenticity.&#13;&#13;Outside, the terrace becomes a tranquil haven - pool, porch, dining beneath the stars. The surrounding garden, though now shaped and curated, still whispers of the pine grove that once stood here, inviting you to pause and breathe.&#13;&#13;Inside, textures are warm and earthy, tones are soft and natural, and every line draws you outward—to the trees, the breeze, the silence.&#13;&#13;House, all in one level, offers 3 bedrooms with 3 ensuite bathrooms and 1 guest toilet. An open plan saloon-kitchen gives access to a covered porch and large open terraces within a 860 m2 plot with a private pool and parking with space for 2 cars.&#13;&#13;This house is not just a renovation; it is a return to a way of living that feels grounded, intentional, and beautifully simple.&#13;&#13;Secure your dream villa in La Fustera, Benissa Costa, and embrace the ultimate Mediterranean lifestyle with unmatched comfort.",

    "description": "NEW BUILD RESIDENTIAL IN EL VERGEL&#13;&#13;New Build residential complex of 1, 2 and 3 bedrooms apartments and penthouses in El Vergel designed as compact structures a response to the architects and designers constant pursuit of efficiency in the development. These decisions, spread throughout the various key points of the residential area, ensure that your home stays at the right temperature both in winter and summer.&#13;&#13;The main feature of the properties will be their large terraces. With regular proportions, they are the ideal spaces for outdoor living. The integration of the living room with these spacious terraces will unite your home as a livable volume where the interior merges with the exterior.&#13;&#13;Moreover, the construction in the area is planned to have minimal impact. The careful selection of construction materials has allowed you to enjoy the extraordinary views offered by the natural environment of residential complex permanently.&#13;&#13;Properties organized around a living room open to a terrace-bedroom. Live inside and outside the house.&#13;&#13;The common areas of this complex embody a deeply natural spirit. As you walk through different areas, you’ll find ideal spaces for strolling, engaging in sports activities, and, above all, using bicycles.&#13;&#13;Gather with your partner, family, or friends at the social clubs; enjoy open squares protected from the sun and unwind in cool spots where vegetation thrives and air constantly circulates.&#13;&#13;What else? Take note: ample and numerous swimming pools scattered throughout the residential area, sensory gardens, spaces for yoga practice, self-consumption vegetable gardens, bicycle workshops, and pet washing zones.&#13;&#13;Always seeking the utmost respect for nature, the project is conceived with brilliant sustainable strategies: rainwater collection, channeling, and reuse systems that will give life to a lush sustainable ecosystem; refreshing gardens with native species that require minimal maintenance; large surfaces of photovoltaic panels for self-consumption energy generation; even multiple charging stations for electric mobile vehicles.&#13;&#13;Luxury is having everything you need while respecting the surrounding ecosystem.​&#13;&#13;All residents of this complex will have access to the Beach Club on the beachfront. Space, where they can organize their own events, have a charging point and parking for electric bikes, store nautical equipment, lockers, and take a shower or dip in the pool after enjoying the sea.&#13;A gateway to the sea on the shores of La Almadraba beach in Denia.&#13;&#13;Just a few meters from La Almadraba beach in El Verger and a few kilometers from Denia, a project is born that defies convention. Its intention is nothing less than making the impossible a reality: a residential development that aspires to become a sustainable, healthy, and respectful community.",
